### Changes to the original method:

#### Readability:
- Use var keyword.
###### Reason: aligns code more nicely and reduces the variativity.
- Method name.
###### Reason: the name is too generic, method name should give hints on what's happening inside of it.
- Method length.
###### Reason: the method is too long hindering the clear overlook of the logic that is being carried out inside of it.

### TODO:
- Add unit tests.
###### Reason: unit tests work best to prevent any time of misfortune may some refactoring happen to a class.
